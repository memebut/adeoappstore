# adeoappstore
What: 
Create an unified portal to:
- inventory any of applications used in Adeo (either made or buyed, for any kind of devices) ; 
- give detailed information on these applications ;
- gather feedback ;
- facilitate contact between people.

How: 
- Creation of an unique Application repo for Adeo applications, as a Ressource ;
- Fetching data from existing systems (Github, Galaxis, Volt, ...) for init, and then become the reference for these systems ;
- Creation of API calls to communicate with these systems if needed (Architecture repo, Projects repo, People repo, Github, Exchange repo, Data Architecture repo : see Architecture target for more) :
- Creation of a web front (ReactJS) to allow User nav into the repository, depending on their profile (see Persona for more).
